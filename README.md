# Dinosaur-Game

## I'm following a tutorial to build a game similar to the dinosaur game from google. This time I would completely change the theme, i'm thinikng to Orrpheous (from Hack Club), but I guess we'll see what I end up with


## I tried to follow a different tutorial in C#, but didn't understand it enough so I switched to this one in CSS and HTML and JS

## Demo  Link:


### Problems:
#### the collisions are off - hard to figure out when to jump
#### replay button not showing
#### animations not working
#### when you reset, the game speeds dramatically

### Fixed:
#### Collisitons arent tht much of an issue anymore
#### replay button and end screen now working just a couple of glitches
#### animations are working but one has white background
#### reset not fixed
