# Dinosaur-Game

## I'm following a tutorial to build a game similar to the dinosour game from google. This time I would completely change the theme, i'm thinikng to Orrpheous (from Hack Club), but I guess we'll see what I end up with

## I tried to follow a different tutorial in C#, but didn't understand it enough so I switched to this one in CSS and HTML and JS
